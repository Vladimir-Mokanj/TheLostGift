# TheLostGift

This project is my portfolio project as well as a project that will teach me how to use Unreal Engine 5 a bit better. It will have many systems that communicate with each other and many different patterns to ease that interaction. As design and implementation are in progress, this readme file will be updated as the system is complete and merged onto the main branch.

Nuclino will be used as the platform for the documentation, and everything that needs to be shown will have a shared link to the documentation itself.

# Game Systems
All of the systems that the game uses and that are implemented can be found below. It will be uploaded at a slow pace because it takes time to design, implement, and test every system that the game uses.

## Item System 0.1
This is the first system that is implemented, and it is the core system of many others in the game. More about this can be found at:

## Loot System 0.1
Implementation of this system is so that it is easy to create/remove and balance monster drop lists. Everything is on Google Sheets which makes it easier to update the drop values for each monster. More about this system can be found at:

## Item Drop System 0.1
Items are now being generated in the world. Their drops are simulated trough physics but they are disabled after X amount of time or when their velocity size is very small. More about this system can be found at:
